				Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.

				Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners. Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do. And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
